# Decidim::ExtraUserFields

This module allows administrators to define a set of extra fields for users. The fields are configurable in the admin panel of the organization. When enabled, they are shown in the user profile and in the registration form.

Supported extra fields for users:

* Country
* Date of birth
* Gender
* Location
* Phone number
* Postal code

This module also enables an Export action in the participants admin panel, which allows to download a list of participants in CSV, JSON or Excel.

## Usage

### Admin setup

After installing the gem and migrating the database, you can enable the extra fields in the admin panel of the organization. Go to Settings > Manage extra user fields. There you can enable the fields you want to use. By default all fields are required and don't include any format validation.

Most of the fields are plain text inputs, but other have a special format:

* Date of birth displays a date picker
* Country displays a country list dropdown

### User signup and profile

Once the fields are enabled, they will be shown in the user signup form and in the user profile.

### Admin users export

An extra feature of this plugin is to enable an Export action in the participants admin panel. This action allows to download a list of participants in CSV, JSON or Excel. The fields included in the export are the Decidim User attributes plus the extra fields enabled in the admin panel.
